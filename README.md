# Playable Card Games

## Overview

This project will aim at creating an application that lets you play card games with other people.
From Go Fish, to Blackjack, to President and more, this application essentially allows you to simulate a deck of cards to play those games.

Some games that are included are:
- Big Two
- Blackjack
- BS
- Egyptian Ratscrew
- Go Fish
- Go Fish **Extreme**
- President
- War

Feel free to play your hearts out.

#### Don't have friends? 

Don't fret, because included in the application is the option to add more CPUs who are quite bad at playing card games!
So whether you don't have any friends or feel like winning a game, just add some CPUs to spice up the game.

## Reason for Creation

When I play card games with people, too many times I hear, "Oh I don't know how to play x."
Well, on a computer, this problem can be alleviated because even if they don't know how to play the game, the UI can highlight playable cards.
This allows for people to get an idea of how to play.
